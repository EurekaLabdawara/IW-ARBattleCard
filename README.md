#IW-AR Battle Card

A PVP AR BATTLE CARD made with Vuforia.

This repository made for backing-up project file.

This project made for my passed assestment. This Project goal is to make a game with AR Cards that pop-up character on top of it. Additionally, making the 3D character to attack to the other 3D enemy on top of the other card when you press one of three virtual button on that card. So, it is best for 2 player to play the game. The winner is the one who knock out the other.

It is still very simple and has some pottential to it.

You could find the image targets (made by me or my friend in the assets folder).

Arranged and design by us.

The code made by IMedia9 under IMedia9 Folder. If you want to use it please contact IMedia9.
The 3D assets not made by us.
